# LMMSE-and-Kalman-Filters
A Matlab program to generate test statistics and interpolate different data samples for a faulty sensor with WSS noise. This is aimed at finding and comparing Least MMSE (Wiener) and Kalman Filters. Kalman Filter uses a Prediction and Correction stage to work on past values to estimate real time values.  

One needs to run only main.m. All functions have descriptions about the code role.
