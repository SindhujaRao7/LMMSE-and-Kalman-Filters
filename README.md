# LMMSE-and-Kalman-Filters
A Matlab program to generate test statistics for a faulty sensor with complex gaussian noise. This is aimed at finding and comparing Least MMSE (Wiener) and Kalman Filters. Kalman Filter uses a prediction and Correction stage to work on past values to estimate real time values.
